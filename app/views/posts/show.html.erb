    <!-- We format a link as an Edit button which directs a user to posts edit page
    edit__topic_post_path(@post) is a helper method that is generated in routes.rb by resources :posts
    edit_topic_post_path takes two arguments, a topic and a post -->
    <% if user_is_authorized_to_create_update_post?(@post) %>
      <%= link_to "Edit", edit_topic_post_path(@post.topic, @post), class: 'btn btn-success' %>
    <% end %>
    <!-- We use link_to to create a delete button. The text on button is Delete Post
      We override the default method (:post) with :delete so that when the button is pressed, the route called is the delete route.
      link_to takes an aray of a topic and post which it uses to build the link to delete a nested post.
      The hash confirms the action with a JS confirmation dialog when a user presses the button -->
    <% if user_is_authorized_to_delete_post?(@post) %>
      <%= link_to "Delete Post", [@post.topic, @post], method: :delete, class: 'btn btn-danger', data: {confirm: 'Are you sure you want to delete this post?'} %>
