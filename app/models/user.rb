  validates :name, length: { minimum: 1, maximum: 100 }, presence: true

  #we validate password with two separate validations:
  #1: executes if password_digest is nil. This ensures that when we create a new user, they have a valid password
  validates :password, presence: true, length: { minimum: 6 }, if: "password_digest.nil?"
  #2 ensures that when updating a user's password, the updated password is also six characters long.
  #allow_blank:true skips the validation if no updated password is given. This allows us to change other attributes on a user without being forced to set the password
  validates :password, length: { minimum: 6 }, allow_blank: true
  #we validate that email is present, unique, case insensitive, has a min & max length and that it is properly formatted
  validates :email,
             presence: true,
             uniqueness: { case_sensitive: false },

  #This function abstracts away much of the complexity of obfuscating user passwords using hashing algorithms which we would otherwise be inclined to write to securely save passwords.
